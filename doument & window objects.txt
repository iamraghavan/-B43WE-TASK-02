In Javascript, the Document Object Model (DOM) is used to represent the structure of a web page and provides an interface for interacting with the elements of the page. 
Two important objects in the DOM are the document and window objects.

The document object represents the entire web page and provides properties and methods for accessing and manipulating the elements of the page. 
The document object can be used to access the HTML elements, their attributes, and their content. 
It also allows you to add new elements to the page, remove existing elements, and change the styling of elements using CSS.

The window object represents the browser window and provides properties and methods for interacting with the browser. 
The window object can be used to change the size and position of the window, create new windows, and manipulate the history of the browser. 
It also provides access to the JavaScript global object and the properties and methods of the browser's Document Object Model (DOM).

In summary, the document object is used to represent the web page and its elements, while the window object represents the browser window and provides properties and methods for interacting with the browser. 
Understanding the difference between these two objects is crucial for web developers as they are commonly used in JavaScript development, particularly in manipulating HTML content.

It is also worth noting that the window object is also the global object in JavaScript and all global variables, 
functions and objects are properties of the window object.
